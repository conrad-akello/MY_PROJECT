<h1><center><tt><a href="biography.html">MY AUTOBIOGRAPHY</a></tt></center></h1>
<tt>
<p>My name is Conrad Ochieng Akello and I was born on the 17th of August, 1992 in Homabay county, Kenya. My parents were John Cyprian Akello Airo and Jackline Akello. I am a partial orphan, one of my parents is deceased. My father died at the age of 42 in 1992 from mild Headache which was the result of malaria. My mother is still alive. Fortunately I have been able to feel the love of a mother.</p>

<p>
My early childhood was a typical low class environment circa the 1990's. My dad worked for the then Kisumu municipal as a works officer and my mom is a stay at home mother. I had a very rough childhood, leaving me somewhat focused in life. My dad died when I was merely a year old. My uncles Eng. Lawrence Airoh and Tobias Airoh became a big part of my life and I maintained close contact with them until now.</p>

<p>
Growing up with partial parent was difficult since my momma had nothing and therefore depended on menial jobs to make ends meet. I joined Ratanga high school at the age of 15, that is after successful completion of pre-school and primary school at Got-Kowiti primary school, which completed in 2006 after garnering 303 marks. I completed form four at Ratanga in 2010 garnering B-(minus) which made me repeat form four at Kericho high, which later I got a B+(pus).</p>

<p>
After high school was admitted to Meru University, the then constituent college of Jomo Kenyatta University (JKUAT), where I studied and graduated with second class honors in Computer Science and Applied Mathematics in 2016.</p>

<p>
I joined central Villa Inn as a cashier in 2016 to 2017, where later moved to Yogi supermarket where worked for only 3 months and it became tough so relocated to home in march 2017, where I started both agricultural and poultry farming up to 2018. In November, 2018 I joined Maseno University for master’s program where I joined to pursue masters in Applied mathematics (yet to graduate). </p>

<p>
In December, 2018 I did interview with KCA university which I passed and was called to service in January, 2019 to be a lecturer in the school of Technology. Through the years grew to become ICDL coordinator and western campus short course’ coordinator. I also expanded my services in the school of business and PTTI.
I got engaged to Veroline in 2019 and todate we have kept the promise of a unified destiny which will soon come to fruition soon as a unified couple.
